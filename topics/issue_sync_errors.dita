<title>Problem Statement</title>

<p>Users are reporting that their files are not syncing between devices or to the cloud server. In some cases, changes made on one device do not appear on another, while in others, files remain stuck in a "sync pending" state indefinitely. The issue may occur intermittently or persist until manual intervention is taken.</p>
<p>Sync errors can significantly disrupt workflow, especially when collaboration or version control is involved. Prompt resolution ensures consistency and avoids data loss.</p>

</problem>

<cause>
<title>Possible Causes</title>

<p>File synchronization problems are typically caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Internet connectivity issues:</b> The sync process requires a stable and active internet connection. Poor signal strength, network drops, or firewall restrictions can block communication with the sync server.</li>
<li><b>Outdated sync client:</b> Using an older version of the sync application may result in compatibility problems with the current server. This can lead to failed sync attempts or incorrect file handling.</li>
<li><b>Account authentication failure:</b> Syncing may be blocked if the user is not properly logged in, or if session tokens have expired.</li>
<li><b>File conflicts or unsupported formats:</b> Files that were edited simultaneously on different devices or files that exceed size limits or use unsupported characters may also fail to sync.</li>
</ul>
</cause>

<remedy>
<title>Possible Solutions</title>

<p>To resolve sync errors, perform the following actions:</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Check internet connectivity:</b>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the device is connected to a stable network.</li>
<li>Open a web browser and verify that other sites load correctly.</li>
<li>Restart the router or switch to another network if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Update the sync client:</b>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application.</li>
<li>Go to the Help or Settings menu and select Check for Updates.</li>
<li>If an update is available, install it and restart the application.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Reauthenticate the user account:</b>
<ul>
<li>Log out and log back into the sync application.</li>
<li>Make sure account credentials are valid.</li>
<li>Reauthorize if prompted to allow permissions again.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Inspect sync status messages:</b>
<ul>
<li>Check for any warning icons or error messages in the sync panel.</li>
<li>Refer to the error code table for next steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Address specific file issues:</b>
<ul>
<li>Rename files that contain special characters.</li>
<li>Reduce file sizes or split large folders if limits are exceeded.</li>
<li>Resolve any conflicting file versions by reviewing timestamps and editing history.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>
